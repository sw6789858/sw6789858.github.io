                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-4">Busiest place in Nha Trang.

The Central District is crowded and noisy, there are many tourists from Russia, there is always somewhere to go - everything is within walking distance: minimarkets and fruit shops, night markets. There are many hotels of different levels of comfort in this area, including chain hotels - Best Western, Sheraton, Novotel and others.</p></blockquote>

If you plan to take a taxi every day, then living here is expensive. The sea in the bay is very calm, and the beach delights with cleanliness. There are not too many hotels here, usually houses are rented in this area. European Quarter in Nha Trang First, let's figure out where it is located. The fact is that in this city there is no line of demarcation of districts. <br><br>However, conditionally, the first three lines from the famous Lotus, located on the embankment, are referred to this site. The European quarter in Nha Trang got its name due to the fact that tourists with a European appearance like to relax here: Americans, Slavs, Europeans. The first, second and third lines of the European quarter serve as a reference point. <br><br>On the opposite side of the European quarter of Nha Trang there is a wonderful green square with gazebos, exercise equipment and benches. One of the most popular restaurants in the city, Sailing Club Bar, operates on the very seashore. The local beach is wide and clean, but the closer to the Lotus tower, the more noisy and crowded it becomes. What to see in Nha Trang on your own? This city has many architectural and historical sights. Many of them can be explored on your own, as they are located within walking distance. We will present you some of them.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Of the last century, the church is in the Gothic style, familiar to Europeans. A tall belfry adorns the building. It has a number of traditional small windows and a dial. Crowning the structure is a stone cross. The height of the cathedral, where nowadays the residence of the ruling bishop is located, is almost 40 meters. Its windows are decorated with magnificent stained glass windows made of colored transparent glass. They fill the building with bright sunlight. Three large bells, which were cast by local craftsmen from copper, were installed on the tower two years after the construction was completed. Work on the chimes continued until 1935. Today it is one of the magnificent Catholic complexes located in Southeast Asia.</p>
